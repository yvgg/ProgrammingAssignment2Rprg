==========================
## The following R functions that are able to create a matrix and get the
## value of the inverse and also cache the results and first check if the 
## inverse has already been calculated, in order to reduce the time consuming
## computation

## makeCacheMatrix creates a matrix, which is really a list containing a 
## function to set the value of the matrix, get the value, set the value 
## of the inverse and get the value of the mean

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getsolve <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setsolve = setsolve,
       getsolve = getsolve)
}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the matrix created with 
## the above function. However, it first checks to see if the inverse has 
## already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and 
## skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data 
## and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setsolve function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getsolve()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setsolve(m)
  m
}
